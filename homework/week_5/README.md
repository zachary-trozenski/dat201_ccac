## DAT-201 Week 5 Homework

# Background Question
Parsing the data PASDA data sets, I came across a a data set containing most (if not every) bridge in the state of Pennsylvania.
It's always a point of pride that Pittsburgh as a city has the most bridges but I was curious about the rest of the state.
What does the distribution of bridges outside of Pittsburgh within the boundaries of PA look like? Does Philadelphia share a high density of bridges as well?
These are the questions I'm trying to answer.
# Rationale and Findings
I elected to go with a heat map as a point map of the state looked absolutely insane and was indecipherable to anyone looking to
get a meaningful understanding of  where the bridges in the state are concentrated. What I noticed was, aside from the obvious concentration of bridges
around Philly and Pittsburgh was how polarized the density was. It seems that the bulk of the bridges are located on the west or east sides of the state,
while the middle (aligning perhaps with the mountainous terrain and lack of major rivers) did not have as many. It is curious that even though there is 
a swath of the Appalachian mountains running through the center that bridges are absent. They seem, based on the map, to be concentrated around bodies of water.
