# dat201_ccac
My name is Zach and I'm a linguist professionally. I've enrolled into CCAC's Data Analytics certificate program
to learn more about how to use software and programming (specifically Python) to help better visualize and tackle problems using
data driven solutions. In my spare time I like to bird-watch, camp, play games, and watch movies.

## About this repo
This repo is intended to house work done at home for class and files worked on or created during class.
(As an aside, git has been a godsend for this purpose. Now I don't have to sent myself a deluge of 
emails for everything to share files.)
